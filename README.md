# wordle-helper

A tool to help you play Wordle! I thought of making this after some learning about regular expressions and a few days of playing Wordle with my family. 

Note that Wordle is using a different word list than this project uses. It shouldn't wreck any of your Wordle games, but may lead to needing to try another word.

I hope you enjoy! Please leave any suggestions or bugs here and I will do my best to get to them!
