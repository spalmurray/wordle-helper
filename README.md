# wordle-helper

A tool to help you play Wordle! I thought of making this after some learning about regular expressions and a few days of playing Wordle with my family. Note that, currently, the suggestions are only for solutions, not acceptable words. I plan on having both visible soon!

I hope you enjoy! Please leave any suggestions or bugs here and I will do my best to get to them!
